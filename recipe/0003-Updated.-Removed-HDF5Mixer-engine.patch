  h5IO.SetEngine("HDF5");
  adios2::Engine h5Reader = h5IO.Open(filename, adios2::Mode::Read);
 
-In addition, with HDF5 distribution greater or equal to 1.11, one can use the engine ``HDF5Mixer``
-to write files with the VDS (virtual dataset) feature from HDF5.
-The corresponding tag in the xml file is: ``<engine type=HDF5Mixer>``

-and a sample code for VDS writer is:
-
-.. code-block:: c++
-
- adios2::IO h5IO = adios.DeclareIO("SomeName");
- h5IO.SetEngine("HDF5Mixer");
- adios2::Engine h5Writer = h5IO.Open(filename, adios2::Mode::Write);
-
 To read back the h5 files generated with VDS to ADIOS2, one can use the HDF5 engine. Please make sure you are using the HDF5 library that has version greater than or equal to 1.11 in ADIOS2.
 
 The h5 file generated by ADIOS2 has two levels of groups:  The top Group, ``/`` and its subgroups: ``Step0`` ... ``StepN``, where ``N`` is number of steps. All datasets belong to the subgroups.
